This is a VBScript (Visual Basic Script) to encode/decode Morse code.

  How does it work?
  -  You just have to put in your letters or your Morse code and then press "OK" to get the decoded/encoded version of your input.

  -  To separate letters, just use a space, and to separate words, use a "/". Here is an example: .... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -.. -.-.--

  -  If you see a "*", it means you have added an unsupported character that the Morse code Script cannot process.
